# # Project Description

# Write a brief description of your project here. 
# 
# Note that projects should be self-sufficient, so make sure to provide enough information and context here for someone to understand what you are doing in your project, and why. 

# My project is a guessing game of numbers. The player starts at level 1 and if they guess correctly, they can move onto the next level. There are 5 levels total. 

# ## Project Code
# 
# If it makes sense for your project, you can have code and outputs here in the notebook as well.

# test it out


# #### Extra Credit (*optional*)
# 
# Replace all of this text with a brief explanation (~3 sentences) of: 
# 1. Your Python Background
# 2. How your project went above and beyond the requirements of the project and/or how you challenged yourself to learn something new with the final project

# Before taking this class, I had absolutely no experience in coding. It was something that I would always hear people talk about but I had never even heard of Python nor did I have any idea or honestly interest in learning about it. I really only took this class because of the programming requirement for Revelle... However, with that being said, I enjoyed this class so much more than I thought I would. At times it was frustrating to get stuck but seeing results and creating things with code is such an amazing feeling. I feel that I went above the requirements of this project because I only needed to create 3 functions and I created much more than that. The reason I did this was because once I got started on this project it just became fun and I wanted to keep going! Figuring out the logistics of the functions in the beginning was difficult but once I got it working it was a breeze from there. I feel that I really challenged myself by taking the time to do the project as opposed to taking the final exam (which I thought I was going to do from the beginning of the quarter!).
